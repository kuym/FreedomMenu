[FreedomPop](http://freedompop.com) is a mobile data service, and like most similar services, it has data limits.
This widget lets you view your account data usage on the same computer you're using on the service, such as with
their plug-in USB device or via the FreedomPop WiFi hotspot device. The utility queries the FreedomPop web service
directly, so **you do not need to be connected with a FreedomPop device for this to work.**

**Currently under development**
